## Power (Socket)
[Type G](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm)(BS 1363 UK, 230-240V)

It's possible to jam a two-prong European [Type C](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeC.htm) into the socket, but it involves shoving a fork/key into the third hole - most convenience stores sell little adapters as well.

## Tipping
No need to tip, leave the coins if you want to get rid of them.

Most hospitality places(hotels, large restaurants etc.) include a 10% service charge, it's however changing with the newly imposed 6% GST.
