## Power (Socket)
[Type G](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm)(BS 1363 UK, 230-240V)

It's possible to jam a two-prong European [Type C](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeC.htm) into the socket, but it involves shoving a fork/key into the third hole - most convenience stores sell little adapters as well.

## Tipping
No need to tip, leave the coins if you want to get rid of them.

Most hospitality places(hotels, large restaurants etc.) include a 10% service charge, it's however changing with the newly imposed 6% GST.

## Getting Around

### Taxi
Use one of the following apps to ensure that the driver will follow the meter:
- [MyTeksi (GrabTaxi)](http://grabtaxi.com/myteksi/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/kuala-lumpur)

Many drivers will refuse to use the meter if during rush hour or if it's raining. Usually best to try and hail a cab off the street and avoid ones that loiter around tourist spots

Midnight surcharge(50%) on pickups between 00:01 - 05:59.

### Train
- [LRT & Monorail](http://www.myrapid.com.my/rail/routes) - three lines: Ampang, Kelana Jaya and Monorail. LRT is basically a metro which are underground in the central part, but on elevated pillars elsewhere. Monorail runs in a semicircle loop around the central part of town.
- [KTM Komuter](http://www.ktmkomuter.com.my/) - two lines: Rawang-Seremban and Sentul-Port Klang. Trains are not as frequent as LRT or Monorail, usually 10-20min wait.
- [ERL](http://www.kliaekspres.com/plan-buy/schedule/) - KLIA Express and Transit trains between KL Sentral and KLIA.

See [map](http://myforum.malayarailway.com/file/n2481385/klang_valley_integrated_rail_map.jpg).

The [Touch'n'Go](http://www.touchngo.com.my/) can be used on all lines except the ERL.
There is also a separate [MyRapid Card](http://www.myrapid.com.my/tickets-fares/myrapid-card) for LRT, Monorail and RapidKL busses.

There is a KLIA Express station in both the main and KLIA2 terminal.
